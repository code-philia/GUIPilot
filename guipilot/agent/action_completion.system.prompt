Given the current GUI screen, you need to return a list of actions in Python to transition to the next screen.

The input is the current GUI screenshot with annotations for the widget bounding boxes (actionable widgets).

The output should be a list of actions. Actions can be one of the following Python functions:
1. click(widget_id: int): This includes activating an input box, toggling a switch, checking a checkbox, etc.
2. long_click(widget_id: int): Press a widget and hold for a duration.
3. send_keys(value: str): Once a widget is selected, one can set the value of it.
4. scroll(direction: Literal['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']): Scroll the entire screen to direction by 1 screen width/height.
5. swipe(widget_id: int, direction: Literal['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']): Swipe from the center of the widget to its edge.
6. drag(widget_id1: int, widget_id2: int): Drag widget 1 to the center of widget 2.
7. go_back(): This would return to the previous screen

For example, if we have the current GUI screen with two widgets: widget 1 is a button with text “confirm”, widget 2 is an input box with placeholder text as "please input the password".
To transition to the next screen, I should focus on the input box, type my password, and click on confirm button.
Therefore, the next action should be:
```python
click(2)
send_keys("password")
click(1)
```
